Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Web Hosting Project


Project Overview:
This project involved the deployment of a static website on GCP, leveraging various services offered by the platform. The main focus was on understanding the architecture of cloud-based web hosting and gaining hands-on experience with GCP tools and services.

Key Components and Steps:

    Google Cloud Storage:
        Created a GCP project and set up a billing account.
        Configured a Google Cloud Storage bucket to store website files.
        Enabled the bucket to serve static content directly over the web.

    Domain Configuration:
        Registered a custom domain name through a domain registrar.
        Configured DNS settings to point the domain to the GCP-hosted website using Google Cloud DNS.

    Website Deployment:
        Uploaded website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the Google Cloud Storage bucket.
        Configured the bucket permissions to allow public access to the website content.

    SSL Certificate:
        Secured the website by obtaining an SSL certificate using Google Cloudâ€™s Load Balancing service.
        Configured HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission between users and the web server.

    Monitoring and Maintenance:
        Set up monitoring using Google Cloud Monitoring to track website performance and uptime.
        Configured alerts to notify of any downtime or performance issues.

Tools and Technologies Used:

    Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Primary cloud service provider for hosting and managing resources.
    Google Cloud Storage: Used for storing and serving static website files.
    Google Cloud DNS: Managed DNS settings for the custom domain.
    Google Cloud Load Balancer: Provided load balancing and SSL termination.
    Google Cloud Monitoring: Used for monitoring website performance and uptime.
    Domain Registrar: For registering and managing the custom domain name.

Outcome:
Successfully deployed a fully functional, scalable, and secure static website on Google Cloud Platform. The project enhanced understanding of GCP services and their integration for web hosting purposes. Demonstrated ability to manage cloud resources, configure DNS settings, secure websites with SSL, and monitor website performance.
